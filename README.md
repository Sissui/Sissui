## Hi!
I will keep it simple.

I'm a linux enthusiast which want to automate the world.
I'm also really into selfhosting and opensource.
I enjoy collecting data on which I base my life decisions, improve my infrastructure or daily automations.

Daily I work on my infrastructure, security, networking or automation of daily tasks and server maintaince which can be seen here:
- [ansible](https://github.com/sissui/ansible)
- [cornelia-cli](https://github.com/sissui/cornelia-cli)
- [cornelia-discord](https://github.com/sissui/cornelia-discord)
- [kubernetes](https://blog.tjbndbl.org/homelab/kubernetes)

Some of my inside projects will be described here: [my blog](https://blog.tjbndbl.org)
