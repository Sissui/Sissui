## Hi!
I will keep it simple.

I'm a linux enthusiast which want to automate the world.
I'm also really into selfhosting and opensource.
I enjoy collecting data on which I base my life decisions, improve my infrastructure or daily automations.

Daily I work on my infrastructure, security, networking or automation of daily tasks and server maintaince.
